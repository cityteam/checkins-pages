## Welcome

[CityTeam](https://cityteam.org) offers programs for outreach to, and
support of homeless communities, as well as recovery from addition,
in several US cities.  See their website for more information.

This application is designed to assist staff at CityTeam Facilities
in recording daily statistics that will be reported (typically on a
monthly basis) to the home office.  The set of statistics being gathered
is based on the standard information that the home office wants to
receive, but can be customized on a per-Facility basis based on the
individual needs or desires of each Facility.

The information covered here is targeted for different user types,
with separate pages customized to meet your needs:
