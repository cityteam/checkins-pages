## Developing

The *Daily Stats Entry* application is composed of two major pieces:
* **Server** A Typescript application, running in a NodeJS based environment,
  that interacts with a Postgres database that contains all persistent data.
* **Client** A Typescript application, based on the React framework, that
  runs inside a user's browser, to provide the user interface, and communicate
  with the server to retrieve and store required information.
