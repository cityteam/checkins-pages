## Select the *Entries* menu option

As the welcome screen indicates, click or touch the `Entries` menu option
at the top of the screen.  You will be directed to a data entry form like this:

{% include image.html file="stats/entering-first.png" caption="Entering Data Form" %}

The information you can enter is organized into **Sections** with one or more
**Categories** of data to be entered.  The set of Sections that are available
to you depends on the permissions that have been associated with your username.

## Make sure the Entries For Date is correct

The date that is presented will be today's date, which is normally the correct
value if you are entering information for the current day.  If it is not the
correct date, use the calendar control to choose which date you want to enter
data for.

## Which Sections are shown?

The set of *Sections* presented to you for entry will depend on what permissions
you have been given by the administrator.  In this case, our test user is
presumably responsible for entering data from the kitchen, so the related *Sections*
are shown -- but not things like clothing that was distributed, or other information
not related to this person's responsibilities.

## Enter numbers for the relevant Categories

Enter the values for the *Categories* you are responsible for.  If there was
no information for this particular date, you can either leave the field blank
or enter a zero.  After entering numbers for Breakfasts and Lunches, the screen
might look like this:

{% include image.html file="stats/entering-second.png" caption="Values Entered but not yet Saved" %}

Note that the `Save` button for the Meals Provided section is now active.  Click
or touch `Save` to cause the values in this *Section* to be saved.  This also
applies if you go back and update values later -- be sure to click or touch
`Save` afterwards.

## Log off when you are done

After you are finished, click the `Log Out` button in the navigation bar.  After
this, the device you are using can be used by someone else who will start again
with the logging in process.
