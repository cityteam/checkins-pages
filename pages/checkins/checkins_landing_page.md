## Welcome

Welcome to the CityTeam Checkins Application, designed to assist CityTeam
Facilities in checking overnight Guests into a CityTeam Facility.

[CityTeam](https://cityteam.org) offers programs for outreach to, and
support of homeless communities, as well as recovery from addition,
in several US cities.  See their website for more information.

The information covered is targeted for different user types, with
separate pages customized to your needs:

* [I need to check in Guests](checkins_user_overview) - This is the primary
  function of this application, where you register each individual and
  assign them a mat (or other sleeping arrangement).

* [I need to administer the Facility and its related information](checkins_admin_overview)
  Your username and password will provide access to additional features
  that let you set up the required information for your CityTeam
  Facility, as well as edit information about each Guest that has
  ever checked in.
