## Welcome

[CityTeam](https://cityteam.org) offers programs for outreach to, and
support of homeless communities, as well as recovery from addition,
in several US cities.  See their website for more information.

This application is designed to assist CityTeam Facilities in checking in
overnight stay Guests at a CityTeam Facility, and providing reports on
overall Guest stay statistics.  The information covered is targeted for
different user types, with separate pages customized to your needs:

| Your Task | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
