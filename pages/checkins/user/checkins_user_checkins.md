## Select a Mat to Assign

Now, we are ready to assign a mat for our first Guest.  Click on any
of the rows that do not currently have a Guest assigned (we will
use mat 2 here), and see that happens next.

## Request the Name of the New Guest

The next person comes up and says his name is *Barney Rubble* (no
real names in our examples!).  It is important to see if this Guest
has stayed at this Facility before.  Let's search all previous Guests
to see if we can find a match.

You can search all previous Guests in one of two ways:
* Type one or more characters in order (upper or lower case does not
  matter).  As you type each character, the list of matches will
  change -- the system finds all names with the characters you have
  typed in **either** the first name **or** the last name.
* Type one or more characters, followed by a space, and then one or
  more additional characters.  The system will return matching names
  where the *first name* contains the first set of characters, and the
  *last name* contains the second set of characters.

Let's try typing **ub** and see what happens.

Note the pagination controls `<` `1` `>` at the top of the screen.
Normally, these will be disabled, but it is possible that there are
too many matches to fit on one page -- then you can use the pagination
controls to page through all the matches, or add a few more characters
to your search to reduce the number.  The important thing is to make
sure that the name you are looking for **does** appear (in which case
you will select it as described below), or you will add this person
as a new guest (as described further down).

If you are curious (or need to know) what dates the matched persons have
checked in before, you can click the *With Checkin Dates* checkbox, and
the system will show all previously recorded checkin dates for each name,
in ascending order.

## Choosing a Repeat Guest

If you find the name of this person on the list of previously checked in
Guests, simply click on their name.  Then, proceed to the
[Complete Assignment Details](#complete-assignment-details)
section below.

## Entering a Brand New Guest

If you do not find this person's name on the list of previously checked in
Guests, click one of the `Add` buttons, and fill out the information for
this new person.

{% include image.html file="checkins/checkin-fourth.png" caption="Adding a New Guest" %}

The first and last names are required, and **must** be unique within this
Facility.  This will be checked as soon as you type the last name.  If you
get a message that the name is not unique, that means you missed seeing it
in the previous step -- simply click the `Back` button, search until you
find this name, and select it as described in
[Choosing A Repeat Guest](#choosing-a-repeat-guest) above.

When you click `Save` to store this person's information, you will automatically
be advanced to the
[Complete Assignment Details](#complete-assignment-details)
section below.

## Complete Assignment Details

Let's assume that you clicked previous Guest *Barney Rubble*.  What you will
see next is a form to record the details related to this particular assignment.

{% include image.html file="checkins/checkin-fifth.png" caption="Complete Assignment Details" %}

The following fields are required:
* **Payment Type** - This is a dropdown list of the available payment types
  for this mat.  Since paying cash is the most common choice, it is the
  default.  The particular rules for your CityTeam facility will dictate
  which other choice to make, under which circumstances (such as picking
  "AG" if an Agency Voucher is being used to house this person tonight,
  or "SW" if a severe weather event means that nothing will be charged
  for this night's stay).
* **Payment Amount** - if cash is received for this night's stay, the amount
  should be recorded here.  If no cash is received, this amount should be
  erased.

The following fields are optional:
* **Shower Time** - If this Guest wishes to take a shower in the morning,
  they can indicate the time they wish to do so.  Enter as HH:MM or
  HH:MM:SS.
* **Wakeup Time** - If this Guest wishes to be awoken at a particular time
  in the morning, they can indicate the time they wish to do so.  Enter as
  HH:MM or HH:MM:SS
* **Comment** - Enter any info that might be useful to other staff related
  to this person.  In our example, we will indicate that Barney is coming
  in after work, later than Guests would normally be accepted.

When you have completed this form, click *Save* to store this assignment,
and return to the updated list of available mats.

However, there will be times you need to change what has been recorded
on a previous assignment.  See [Adjusting Existing Checkins](checkins_user_adjusting)
for information on how to do that.
